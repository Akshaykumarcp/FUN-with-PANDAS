# 1. what is pandas ?
- Popular python library for analyzing and transforming structured data
- Open library that integrates with matplotlib
- Pandas has a flexible data structure called as dataframe which is similar to spreadsheet
- Pandas can read & write many types of data formats, such as CSV or excel files.

# 2. Why use Pandas ?
- Dataframe: Easy to use & efficient object for data manipulation
- Handle inconsistent data: Find and fix missing data
- Select & query dataframes: Select rows, columns or filter rows based on a query
- Aggregation and plotting: Group rows and generate high quality plots with a few lines of code
